## RuSentRel Experiment tools

Experiments application of Neural Network Models (training/testing) 
in Sentiment Attitude Extraction Task, mainly applicable for RuSentRel collection.

Supported experiments:
* `exp_sl` (RuSentRel) -- corresponds to Two/Three Scale, CV-based experiment in a supervised learning format.
* `exp_ds` (RuAttitudes) -- corresponds to Two/Three Scale experiment for models pretraining (Training only).
* `exp_joined` (RuSentRel + RuAttitudes) -- is a combination of supervised learning with distant supervision application 
(RuAttitudes) in model training process.
