In particular, this framework serves the following features: 
* ‚ûø [pipelines](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit/wiki/Pipelines:-Text-Opinion-Annotation) and iterators for handling large-scale collections serialization without out-of-memory issues.
* üîó EL (entity-linking) API support for objects, 
* ‚û∞ avoidance of cyclic connections,
* :straight_ruler: distance consideration between relation participants (in `terms` or `sentences`),
* üìë relations annotations and filtering rules,
* *Ô∏è‚É£ entities formatting or masking, and more.

The core functionality includes: 
* API for document presentation with EL (Entity Linking, i.e. Object Synonymy) support 
for sentence level relations preparation (dubbed as contexts);
* API for contexts extraction;
* Relations transferring from sentence-level onto document-level, and more.
